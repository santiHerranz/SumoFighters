## Robot strategies
The goal is to push the opponent out of the ring.

- Idle, don't waste your energy
- Wait, idle some time and then change strategy
- Face opponent, spin arround and check for rays reflection to keep opponent in front
- Keep inside dojo, spin arround to detect the ring border then steer moving to the center
- Seek, face opponent and go towards him
- Flee, same as seek but in the opposite direction
- Pursue, face opponent, calculate where will be at current speed and go towards that position
- Evade, same as pursue but in the opposite direction
- Attack, Seek and push him out of the ring
- Defend, face opponent and push when contact
- Remote control

## Energy
- Movements cost energy
- Forward and backward cost is proportional to distance
- Rotation cost is porportional to time


## Effects
- Trails\n when robot moves 
- Particles\n when robots collides
